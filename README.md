# InflatableUmbrella
I am not quiet sure if we can build an inflatable umbrella, to start a new era of water-proofing, at least ultraviolet rays-proofing.  
The reason I wanna do it is that the basic structure of umbrella has not been changed for thounds years since it was invented.  
Even in modern times with advanced technology, umbrella retraction and wet umbrella cloth are still bothering us.
Those are the reasons I don't like to take an umbrella. But sometimes we have to have one beacause of strong sunshine at noon in summer or cold rain in winter.

We know leaf veins have a very strong structure. So I am wondering if it possible to make an inflatable umbrella that has thousands of veins can be inflated with air. When you want to open the umbrella, just pushing a stick and the surface of umbrella will be stretched out because the veins structure are filled with air. And you can retract it by pressing a single button, the air will come back to the well designed stick.

You no longer need to tidy the umbrella, because the surface of it will be squeezed into the stick when you close the umbrella. Next, you just need to put on a waterproof cover to avoid the pain caused by rain.  

It can be chanllenging to say the inflatable umbrella can save you in a heavy rain, unless we can prove it later. But it should be fine to save you from ultraviolet light if the wind is just mild.
